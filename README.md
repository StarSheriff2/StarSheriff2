### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; <img src="images/sheriff_star.jpeg" alt="sheriff star" width="30">

I'm Arturo. I hold a degree in Business Management and a degree in Leadership and New Ventures from **[MIT Bootcamps](https://bootcamps.mit.edu/)**

I love to build stuff, use creativity to solve problems and tech entrepreneurship. I started an online eCommerce venture to connect local small-holder coffee producers with consumers in 2015 (the site is no longer live).

I am currently a student in Microverse and want to become a remote, full-stalk web developer.

- ðŸ”­ I have completed some projects already which you can see in my repo page [here](https://github.com/StarSheriff2?tab=repositories).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git workflows, and expect to become fluent in Ruby and Rails too
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can dance Salsa

Iâ€™m currently exploring new opportunities.
